# Stock-Analysis
### Overview of Project: 
In this project, we helped Steve, who recently graduated with a finance degree, determine which green energy stock his parents should invest in. Steve's parents are particularly interested in investing in DAQO Energy corporation (DQ). We helped Steve analyze DQ's stock, along with a list of other green energy stocks to diversify their funds. Once we completed the analysis, we then refactored the code so we could go through thousands of stocks more efficiently and faster than the previous analysis. 

### Results: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
* A majority of the stocks in 2017 did worse 2018 except for ENPH and RUN for the expected return percentage.
* In 2017, TERP had a negative percentage of -7.2% and decreased the negative performance to -5%.
* Out of all the stocks, VSLR had a small decrease in returns with -3.5% in 2018.
* My refactored code had a run time of 0.15 and was slightly faster than my original of 0.52 seconds.

### Summary: 
The advantage of refactoring code is that it could make the analysis run faster by eliminating any repetitive loops or combining functions. However, this can create more of a chance for errors. Overall, refactoring can be beneficial when utilizing the button functionality of VBA. For analyses that stay the same and must be run frequently, this is a good solution. However, if an analysis expands or the focus shifts, it may be more beneficial to start fresh.
